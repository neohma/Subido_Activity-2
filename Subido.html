        <h2><strong>✨About Me✨</strong></h2>
        <p>
          With all honesty, I’ve been struggling to find the exact words to
          describe how I am as a human being living in this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Up to now, I find it extremely difficult whenever I am asked,
          <em>“Who are you?” “Can you describe yourself?” </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Except for knowing my name,this is a little information that I know
          about myself. I’m an introverted person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of my relatives told me that I am a boring person which is not to
          me. I prefer to be alone than to socialize.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hobby is reading—fiction books, not educational ones. I enjoy
          studying too, though I’m not the smartest, but I am very studious.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am the student who passed the activity early. I am not a
          <em>“Due Tomorrow Do Tomorrow” </em>type of student. I value time and
          hate cramming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like both the sunset and moonlight. Though I wake up early, I prefer
          the calm of the night. As for food, I love spicy dishes.
        </p>
        <p>
          To me, food without spice is just dull. I fear certain things, like
          slimy creatures and cockroaches, but I aim to overcome these fears.
        </p>
        <p>And lastly, <em>Privacy is very important to me. </em></p>

        <h2><strong>Programming Journey:</strong></h2>
        <p>
          As a third-year student in the Bachelor of Science in Information
          Systems (BSIS) program,
        </p>
        <p>
          programming has been a journey full of ups and downs. While I have a
          clear understanding of how
        </p>
        <p>
          programs execute and how things work behind the scenes, I often find
          it challenging to create code
        </p>
        <p>
          from scratch. I frequently rely on Google or ask for help when trying
          to build something on my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s as if I’m a grade school student who understands the concept but
          struggles to write it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I can follow the logic and steps of a program, creating
          something original is still a hurdle
        </p>
        <p>
          for me. Coding doesn’t come naturally yet, but I am determined to
          improve this skill with time and practice.

        <h2>Project 1: Code Craze 2048</h2>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> 2048 is a simple yet addictive puzzle game where the goal is to slide numbered tiles together to create tiles with higher values. By swiping the tiles up, down, left, or right, you can move them. If two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a single tile with the sum of their values. The game ends when no more moves can be made, and the highest tile value achieved is your score.</p>

        <h2>Project 2: Library Management</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong> This library management system allows users to manage a collection of books in a library. Users can perform actions like adding new books, removing existing books, searching for books by title, searching for books by category, borrowing books, and returning books. The system also keeps track of student and staff borrowers, including any penalties they may incur.</p>

        <h2>Project 3: ATM Simulation</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong> ATM Simulation, allowing users to perform various banking operations. It includes features like account creation, authentication, deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and PIN changes. The code utilizes structures to represent ATM cards and transactions, and functions to handle different operations. It also incorporates file I/O for saving account data and error handling for invalid inputs. Additionally, the simulation includes a flash drive detection mechanism to ensure the system is only accessible when the required flash drive is inserted.</p>
